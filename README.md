### Peer Review


**Reviewer:** Charles Orr
 

**Reviewer Notes:** everything looks good, only recommendation i have is that in the total per person section i recommend adding "overflow-y-auto" so that if someone enters a super big number it doesnt go off the page after calculations, aside from that recommendation i think it looks great, keep it up :)
